# Eyes of Minute Seeing
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  



These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, your vision improves significantly out to a range of 1 foot, granting you [Darkvision](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) within that range and [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Intelligence ([Investigation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) checks made to examine something within that range.
