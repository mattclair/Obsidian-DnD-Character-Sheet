A Tinderbox is a small container holding flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a [Candle](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/candle-xphb.md), [Lamp](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/lamp-xphb.md), [Lantern](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/hooded-lantern-xphb.md), or [Torch](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/torch-xphb.md)—or anything else with exposed fuel—takes a [Bonus Action](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md). Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.
