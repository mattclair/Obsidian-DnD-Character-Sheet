# Cloak of Displacement
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/cloak-of-displacement.webp#right)


While you wear this cloak, it magically projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have [Disadvantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while your [Speed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is 0.
