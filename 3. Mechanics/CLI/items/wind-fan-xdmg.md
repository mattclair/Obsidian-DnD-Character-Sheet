# Wind Fan
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/wind-fan.webp#right)


While holding this fan, you can cast [Gust of Wind](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md) (save DC 13) from it. Each subsequent time the fan is used before the next dawn, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working; if the fan fails to work, it tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.
