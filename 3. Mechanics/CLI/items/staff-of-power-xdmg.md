This staff has 20 charges and can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to [Armor Class](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md), saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

## Spells

| Spell | Charge Cost |
|-------|-------------|
| [Cone of Cold](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/cone-of-cold-xphb.md) | 5 |
| [Fireball](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball-xphb.md) (level 5 version) | 5 |
| [Globe of Invulnerability](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/globe-of-invulnerability-xphb.md) | 6 |

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `2d8 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains `1d8 + 2` charges.

## Retributive Strike

You can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its magic in an explosion that fills a 30-foot [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from itself. You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take Force damage equal to 16 times the number of charges in the staff . Each other creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes Force damage equal to 4 times the number of charges in the staff . On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
