# Bolt
*Ammunition*  


- **Cost**: 5 cp
- **Weight**: 0.075 lbs.

Crossbow bolts are used with a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

Bolts are typically stored in a [Crossbow Bolt Case](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/crossbow-bolt-case-xphb.md) (bought separately).
