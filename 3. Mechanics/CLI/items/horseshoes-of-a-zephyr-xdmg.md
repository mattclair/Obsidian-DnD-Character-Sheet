# Horseshoes of a Zephyr
*Wondrous item, very rare*  



These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action.

While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above a surface. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores [Difficult Terrain](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md). In addition, the creature can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining [Exhaustion](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) levels from extended travel.
