# Crystal Ball of Telepathy
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  


- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [Scrying](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying-xphb.md) (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also cast [Suggestion](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion-xphb.md) (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this [Suggestion](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion-xphb.md) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [Scrying](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying-xphb.md) ends. You can't cast [Suggestion](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion-xphb.md) in this way again until the next dawn.
