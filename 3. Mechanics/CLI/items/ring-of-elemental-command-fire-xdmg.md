# Ring of Elemental Command (Fire)
*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*  



The Ring of Elemental Command (fire) is linked to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Every Ring of Elemental Command has the following two properties:

- **Elemental Bane.** While wearing the ring, you have [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against Elementals and they have [Disadvantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against you.  
- **Elemental Compulsion.** While wearing the ring, you can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to try to compel an Elemental you see within 60 feet of yourself. The Elemental makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the Elemental has the [Charmed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn.  

## Elemental Focus

While wearing the ring, you benefit from additional properties corresponding to the ring's linked Elemental Plane:

- **Fire.** You know Ignan, and you have [Immunity](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Fire damage.  

## Spellcasting

The ring has 5 charges and regains `1d4 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can cast a spell from it. A spell cast from the ring has a save DC of 18. Choose the spell from the following list: [Burning Hands](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/burning-hands-xphb.md) (1 charge), [Fireball](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball-xphb.md) (2 charges), [Fire Storm](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/fire-storm-xphb.md) (4 charges), [Wall of Fire](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-fire-xphb.md) (3 charges)
