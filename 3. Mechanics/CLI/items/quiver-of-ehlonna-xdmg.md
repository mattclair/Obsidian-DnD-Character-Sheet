# Quiver of Ehlonna
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/quiver-of-ehlonna.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 60 [Arrows](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/arrow-xphb.md), [Bolts](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/bolt-xphb.md), or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 [Javelins](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/javelin-xphb.md) or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows, [Quarterstaff's](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/quarterstaff-xphb.md), or [Spears](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/spear-xphb.md).

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
