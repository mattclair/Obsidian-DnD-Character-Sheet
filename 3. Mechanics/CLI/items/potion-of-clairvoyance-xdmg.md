# Potion of Clairvoyance
*Potion, rare*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [Clairvoyance](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/clairvoyance-xphb.md) spell (no [Concentration](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) required).

An eyeball bobs in this potion's yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.
