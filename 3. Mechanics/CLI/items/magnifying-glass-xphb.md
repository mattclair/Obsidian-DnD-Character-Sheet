A Magnifying Glass grants [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on any ability check made to appraise or inspect a highly detailed item. Lighting a fire with a Magnifying Glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite.
