# Goggles of Night
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/goggles-of-night.webp#right)


While wearing these dark lenses, you have [Darkvision](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to 60 feet. If you already have [Darkvision](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision), wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
