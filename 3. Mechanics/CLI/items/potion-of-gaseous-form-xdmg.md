# Potion of Gaseous Form
*Potion, rare*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [Gaseous Form](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form-xphb.md) spell for 1 hour (no [Concentration](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) required) or until you end the effect as a [Bonus Action](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).

This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
