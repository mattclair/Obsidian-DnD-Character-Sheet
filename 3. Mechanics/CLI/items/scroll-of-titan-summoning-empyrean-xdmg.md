# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Empyrean)
*Scroll, legendary*  



When you take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to read this scroll, an [Empyrean](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/miscellaneous/empyrean-xmm.md) appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself.

The [Empyrean](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/miscellaneous/empyrean-xmm.md) is [Hostile](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb.md) toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If the [Empyrean](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/miscellaneous/empyrean-xmm.md) is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
