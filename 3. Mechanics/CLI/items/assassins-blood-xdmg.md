# Assassin's Blood
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 150 gp

A creature subjected to Assassin's Blood makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6 (`1d12`) Poison damage and has the [Poisoned](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
