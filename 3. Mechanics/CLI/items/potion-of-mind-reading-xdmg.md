# Potion of Mind Reading
*Potion, rare*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [Detect Thoughts](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts-xphb.md) spell (save DC 13) for 10 minutes (no [Concentration](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) required).

This potion's dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.
