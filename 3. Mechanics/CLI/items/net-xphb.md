# Net
*Adventuring gear*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/net.webp#right)

- **Cost**: 1 gp
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

When you take the [Attack](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a Net. Target a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [Proficiency Bonus](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md)) or have the [Restrained](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until it escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it is Huge or larger.

To escape, the target or a creature within 5 feet of it must take an action to make a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, freeing the [Restrained](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature on a success. Destroying the Net (AC 10; 5 HP; [Immunity](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage) also frees the target, ending the effect.
