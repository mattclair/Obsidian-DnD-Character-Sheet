# Half Plate Armor of Etherealness
*Medium armor, legendary (requires attunement)*  


- **Armor Class**: 15 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs.

While you're wearing this armor, you can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action and use a command word to gain the effect of the [Etherealness](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/etherealness-xphb.md) spell. The spell ends immediately if you remove the armor or take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to repeat the command word. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dawn.
