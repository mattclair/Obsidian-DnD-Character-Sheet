# Elixir of Health
*Potion, rare*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you are cured of all magical contagions. In addition, the following conditions end on you: [Blinded](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [Deafened](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), [Paralyzed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), and [Poisoned](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned).

The clear, red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
