# Mariner's Armor
*Uncommon*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/mariners-armor.webp#right)


While wearing this armor, you have a [Swim Speed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md). In addition, if you start your turn underwater with 0 [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), you immediately regain `1d4` [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). The armor can't heal anyone again until the next dawn.

The armor is decorated with fish and shell motifs.
