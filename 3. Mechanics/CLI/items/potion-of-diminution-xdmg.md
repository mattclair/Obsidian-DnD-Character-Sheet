# Potion of Diminution
*Potion, rare*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the [Enlarge/Reduce](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/enlarge-reduce-xphb.md) spell for `1d4` hours (no [Concentration](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) required).

The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
