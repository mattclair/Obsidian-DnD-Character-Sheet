# Oil
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 1 sp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

You can douse a creature, object, or space with Oil or use it as fuel, as detailed below.

## Dousing a Creature or an Object

When you take the [Attack](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing an Oil flask. Target one creature or object within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [Proficiency Bonus](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md)) or be covered in oil. If the target takes Fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an extra 5 Fire damage from burning oil.

## Dousing a Space

You can take the [Utilize](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action to pour an Oil flask on level ground to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of the turn 2 rounds from when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

## Fuel

Oil serves as fuel for Lamps and Lanterns. Once lit, a flask of Oil burns for 6 hours in a Lamp or Lantern. That duration doesn't need to be consecutive; you can extinguish the burning Oil (as a [Utilize](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action) and rekindle it again until it has burned for a total of 6 hours.
