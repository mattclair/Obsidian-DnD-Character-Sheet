# Circlet of Blasting
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/circlet-of-blasting.webp#right)


While wearing this circlet, you can cast [Scorching Ray](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/scorching-ray-xphb.md) with it (`+5` to hit). The circlet can't cast this spell again until the next dawn.
