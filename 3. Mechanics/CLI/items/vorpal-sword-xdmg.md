# Vorpal Sword
*Legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/vorpal-sword.webp#right)


You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores [Resistance](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Slashing damage.

When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the `d20` for the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it has [Immunity](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Slashing damage, if it doesn't have or need a head, or if the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 30 Slashing damage from the hit. If the creature has Legendary [Resistance](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md), it can expend one daily use of that trait to avoid losing its head, taking the extra damage instead.
