*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/boots-of-elvenkind.webp#right)


While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Stealth](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.
