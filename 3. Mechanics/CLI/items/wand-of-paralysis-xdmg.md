# Wand of Paralysis
*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/wand-of-paralysis.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [Paralyzed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
