# Talisman of Ultimate Evil
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/talisman-of-ultimate-evil.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that isn't a Fiend or an Undead that touches the talisman takes `8d6` Necrotic damage and takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

## Holy Symbol

You can use the talisman as a Holy Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

## Ultimate End

The talisman has 6 charges. While wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is a Celestial, it has [Disadvantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn't cast into the fissure but takes `4d6` Psychic damage from the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.
