# Iron Bands of Bilarro
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/iron-bands-of-bilarro.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your [Proficiency Bonus](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md). On a hit, the target has the [Restrained](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until you take a [Bonus Action](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature that can touch the bands, including the one [Restrained](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the [Restrained](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.
