# Sovereign Glue
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/sovereign-glue.webp#right)


This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [Oil of Slipperiness](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/oil-of-slipperiness-xdmg.md). When found, a container contains `1d6 + 1` ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes a [Utilize](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [Universal Solvent](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/universal-solvent-xdmg.md) or [Oil of Etherealness](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/oil-of-etherealness-xdmg.md), or with a [Wish](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell.
