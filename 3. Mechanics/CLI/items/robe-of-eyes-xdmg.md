# Robe of Eyes
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/robe-of-eyes.webp#right)


This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

- **All-Around Vision.** The robe gives you [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Wisdom ([Perception](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.  
- **Special Senses.** You have [Darkvision](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) and [Truesight](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Truesight), both with a range of 120 feet.  

## Drawbacks

A [Light](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/light-xphb.md) spell cast on the robe or a [Daylight](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/daylight-xphb.md) spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives you the [Blinded](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for Light or DC 15 for Daylight), ending the condition on yourself on a success.
