# Sword of Kas
*Weapon ([longsword](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword-xphb.md)), artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/sword-of-kas.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 slashing
  - Two-handed: 1d10 slashing
- **Properties**: [Versatile](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

Kas was a powerful warrior who served "Vecna" and whose loyalty was rewarded with this sword. As Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. The sword urged Kas to destroy Vecna and usurp his throne. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind.

## Bloodthirst

The sword thirsts for blood. If the sword doesn't taste blood on its blade within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes `3d6` Psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the [Dominate Monster](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-monster-xphb.md) spell, and the sword demands blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.

## Magic Weapon

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword, which scores a [Critical Hit](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/critical-hit-xphb.md) on a roll of 19 or 20 on the `d20` and deals an extra `2d10` Slashing damage to Undead.

## Random Properties

The sword has the following random properties:

- 1 [minor beneficial](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties-xdmg.md) property  
- 1 [major beneficial](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties-xdmg.md) property  
- 1 [minor detrimental](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties-xdmg.md) property  
- 1 [major detrimental](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/tables/artifact-properties-major-detrimental-properties-xdmg.md) property  

## Spells

While the sword is on your person, you can cast the following spells (save DC 18) from it:

- [Call Lightning](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/call-lightning-xphb.md)  
- [Divine Word](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/divine-word-xphb.md)  
- [Finger of Death](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/finger-of-death-xphb.md)  

Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.

## Spirit of Kas

While the sword is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

- **Battle Hunger.** You add `1d10` to your [Initiative](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) rolls.  
- **Blade of Defense.** When you take an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your [Armor Class](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md) instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.  
- **Necrotic Resistance.** You have [Resistance](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Necrotic damage.  

## Sentience

The Sword of Kas is a sentient Chaotic Evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and [Darkvision](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Common.

## Personality

The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.

The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the [Eye and Hand of Vecna](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/eye-and-hand-of-vecna-xdmg.md).

## Destroying the Sword

A creature attuned to both the [Eye of Vecna](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/eye-of-vecna-xdmg.md) and the [Hand of Vecna](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/hand-of-vecna-xdmg.md) can use the [Wish](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb.md) property of those combined Artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas, provided the sword is within 30 feet of the spell's caster. Upon casting Wish, the creature makes a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, nothing happens, and the [Wish](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell is wasted. On a successful save, the Sword of Kas is destroyed.
