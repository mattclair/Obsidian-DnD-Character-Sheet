You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this sword. In addition, while you hold the sword, you can take a [Reaction](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to make one melee attack with it against any creature in your reach that deals damage to you. You have [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on the attack roll, and any damage dealt with this special attack ignores any [Immunity](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) or [Resistance](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) the target has to that damage.
