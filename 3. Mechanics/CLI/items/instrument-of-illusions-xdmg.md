# Instrument of Illusions
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/instrument-of-illusions.webp#right)


While you are playing this [musical instrument](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/musical-instrument-xphb.md), you can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to create harmless, illusory visual effects within a 5-foot [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from the instrument. If you are a Bard, the size of the [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing.
