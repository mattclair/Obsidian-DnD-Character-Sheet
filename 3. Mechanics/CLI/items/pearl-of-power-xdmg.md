# Pearl of Power
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  



While this pearl is on your person, you can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to regain one expended spell slot of level 3 or lower. Once you use the pearl, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
