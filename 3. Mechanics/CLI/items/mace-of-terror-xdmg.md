# Mace of Terror
*Weapon ([mace](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/mace-xphb.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/mace-of-terror.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d6 bludgeoning
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition for 1 minute. While [Frightened](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't make [Opportunity Attacks](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack). For its action, it can use only the [Dash](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the [Dodge](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
