# Censer of Controlling Air Elementals
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/img/censer-of-controlling-air-elementals.webp#right)


While gently swinging this censer, you can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to summon an [Air Elemental](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental-xmm.md). The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the censer as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [Initiative](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [Bonus Action](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md). The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
