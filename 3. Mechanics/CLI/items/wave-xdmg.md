# Wave
*Weapon ([trident](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/items/trident-xphb.md)), artifact (requires attunement)*  


- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 piercing
  - Two-handed: 1d10 piercing
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Thrown](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown), [Versatile](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, Wave is engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on the `d20` for an attack roll with this weapon, the target takes an extra 21 Necrotic damage.

While holding Wave, you gain the following benefits:

- **Combat Ready.** You have [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on [Initiative](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) rolls.  
- **Underwater Adaptation.** A bubble of air forms around your head while you are underwater, allowing you to breathe normally in that environment.  

## Aquatic Command

Wave has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While you carry it, you can expend 1 charge to cast [Dominate Beast](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-beast-xphb.md) (save DC 20) from it on a Beast that has a [Swim Speed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md).

## Globe of Invulnerability

While holding Wave, you can cast the level 9 version of [Globe of Invulnerability](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/globe-of-invulnerability-xphb.md) from it. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Sentience

Wave is a sentient weapon of Neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and [Darkvision](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Aquan.

## Personality

Wave zealously encourages mortals to worship sea gods and has a habit of humming sea chanteys. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon's objectives in the world.

## Destroying Wave

Wave can be destroyed only on the island of Thunderforge, where it was forged. The weapon must be melted down by a [storm giant](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant-xmm.md) or someone imbued with a storm giant's strength. Destroying Wave angers a god of the sea, who sends powerful agents to attack the island and punish the destroyers.
