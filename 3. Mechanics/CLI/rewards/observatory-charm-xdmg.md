# Observatory Charm
*Charm*  

You can use your Observatory to peer into the far corners of "Wildspace" and the "Astral Plane". After spending a Long Rest in your Observatory, you gain a magical Charm (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [Contact Other Plane](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/contact-other-plane-xphb.md) without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.
