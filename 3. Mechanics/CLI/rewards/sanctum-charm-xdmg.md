# Sanctum Charm
*Charm*  

After spending a [Long Rest](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md) in your "Bastion", you gain a magical Charm (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [Heal](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal-xphb.md) once without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.
