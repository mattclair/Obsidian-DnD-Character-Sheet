# Kraken

## Regional Effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a kraken's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Ocean Tyrant.** The kraken exerts its dominance over animals in its domain. All Beasts within 1 mile of the lair have the [Charmed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition while in that area.  
- **Sea and Storms.** While in its lair, the kraken can cast [Control Weather](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-weather-xphb.md), requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability.  

If the kraken dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
