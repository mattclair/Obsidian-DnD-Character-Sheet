# Unicorn

## Regional Effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a unicorn's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Obscuring Foliage.** The unicorn and its allies have [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Stealth](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks while within 1 mile of the lair.  
- **Positive Energy.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) from a spell, it regains the maximum number of [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) possible. Additionally, the effects of curses are suppressed within 1 mile of the lair.  

If the unicorn dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
