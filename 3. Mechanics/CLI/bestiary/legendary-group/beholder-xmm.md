# Beholder

## Regional Effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a beholder's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Scopophobia.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they're being watched. Any creature (excluding the beholder and its allies) that finishes a [Short Rest](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.  
- **Warping Terrain.** Minor warps in reality occur near the lair; any creature (excluding the beholder) within 1 mile of the lair that makes a [D20 Test](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md) and rolls a 1 has the [Prone](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition.  

If the beholder dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
