# Lich

## Regional Effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a lich's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **All-Seeing.** While in its lair, the lich can cast [Clairvoyance](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/clairvoyance-xphb.md), requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action.  
- **Inevitable Siphon.** Whenever a Humanoid dies within 1 mile of the lair, its soul is immediately consumed by the lich. A Humanoid whose soul is consumed in this way can be brought back to life only by a True Resurrection or [Wish](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell.  

If the lich is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. These effects resume if the lich gains a new body (see its Spirit Jar trait).
