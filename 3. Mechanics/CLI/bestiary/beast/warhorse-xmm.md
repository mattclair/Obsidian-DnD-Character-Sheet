## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.
