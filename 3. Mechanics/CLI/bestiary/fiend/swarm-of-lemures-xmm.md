# [Swarm of Lemures](3. Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fiend/swarm-of-lemures-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 194*  

When devils drive hosts of lemures into close proximity or when lemures compress into a single mass, a swarm forms and adopts a unified mind.

## Lemures

*Devils of Agony and Despair*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Nine Hells)  
- **Treasure.** None  

The least of all devils, lemures arise from wicked souls, their mortal memories scoured away. Only vague limbs and anguished features jut from these slurries of infernal proto-matter.
