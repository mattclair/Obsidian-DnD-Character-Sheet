# Climbing
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

While you're climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in [difficult terrain](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md)). You ignore this extra cost if you have a [Climb Speed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb.md) and use it to climb. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.
