# Skill
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 374. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A skill is an "area of specialization" associated with an ability check. If you have proficiency in a skill, you can add your [Proficiency Bonus](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md) when you make an ability check associated with that skill.
