# Training to Gain Levels
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 49* 

As a variant rule, you can require characters to spend time between adventures training or studying before they gain the benefits of a new level. This variant slows the passage of time in the game world, which can help support a more realistic or gritty tone in your campaign.

If you choose this option, after earning enough Experience Points to attain a new level, a character must train for a number of days before gaining any class features associated with the new level. You can decide whether the character can train independently or requires a trainer.

The training time required depends on the level to be gained, as shown on the Training to Gain Levels table. The training cost is for the total training time.
