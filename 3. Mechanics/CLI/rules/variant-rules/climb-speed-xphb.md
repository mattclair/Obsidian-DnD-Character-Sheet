# Climb Speed
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A Climb Speed can be used in place of [Speed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) to traverse a vertical surface without expending the extra movement normally associated with climbing.
