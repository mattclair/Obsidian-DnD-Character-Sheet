# Immunity
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 369. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

If you have Immunity to a [damage type](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/damage-types-xphb.md) or a [condition](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/condition-xphb.md), it doesn't affect you in any way.
