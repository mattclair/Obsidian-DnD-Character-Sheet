# Emanation [Area of Effect]
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

An Emanation is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a creature or an object in all directions. The effect that creates an Emanation specifies the distance it extends.

An Emanation moves with the creature or object that is its origin unless it is an instantaneous or a stationary effect.

An Emanation's origin (creature or object) isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.
