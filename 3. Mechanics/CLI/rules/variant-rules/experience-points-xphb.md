# Experience Points
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

As they overcome challenges and complete adventures, characters earn Experience Points (XP) which are awarded by the Dungeon Master. When a character's XP total crosses certain thresholds, the character's level increases. The "Dungeon Master's Guide" provides guidance on awarding XP.
