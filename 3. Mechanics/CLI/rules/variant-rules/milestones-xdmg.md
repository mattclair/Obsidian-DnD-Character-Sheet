# Milestones
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 49* 

You can also award XP when characters complete significant milestones. When preparing your adventure, designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as with the following examples:

- Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to complete the adventure.  
- Discovering a hidden location or piece of information relevant to the adventure.  
- Reaching an important destination.  

When awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a high-difficulty encounter and a minor milestone as a low-difficulty encounter.

## Other Milestone Rewards

If you want to reward your players for their progress through an adventure with something more than XP and treasure, also give them small rewards at milestone points, such as the following:

- The adventurers gain the benefit of a Short Rest.  
- Characters recover a Hit Point Die or a level 1 spell slot.  
- Characters regain the use of magic items that have had their limited uses expended.
