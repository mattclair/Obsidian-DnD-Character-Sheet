# Resistance
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

If you have Resistance to a [damage type](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/damage-types-xphb.md), damage of that type is halved against you (round down). Resistance is applied only once to an instance of damage.
