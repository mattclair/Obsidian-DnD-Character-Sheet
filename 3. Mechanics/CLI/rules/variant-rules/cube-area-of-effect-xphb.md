# Cube [Area of Effect]
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A Cube is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube specifies its size, which is the length of each side. A Cube's point of origin isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.
