*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 374. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A creature is Stable if it has 0 [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) but isn't required to make [Death Saving Throws](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/death-saving-throw-xphb.md).
