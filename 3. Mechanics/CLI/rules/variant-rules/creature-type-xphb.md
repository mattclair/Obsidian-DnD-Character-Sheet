# Creature Type
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Every creature, including every [player character](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/player-character-xphb.md), has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature it is. Most [player characters](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/player-character-xphb.md) are of the Humanoid type. These are the game's creature types:

- Aberration  
- Beast  
- Celestial  
- Construct  
- Dragon  
- Elemental  
- Fey  
- Fiend  
- Giant  
- Humanoid  
- Monstrosity  
- Ooze  
- Plant  
- Undead  

The types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways.
