# Demiplane
*Level 17 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: Ability to use an [Arcane Focus](arcane-focus-xphb.md) or tool as a [Spellcasting Focus](spellcasting-focus-xphb.md)
- **Space**: Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: empower

A door up to 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall appears on a flat, solid surface in one of the other facilities in your Bastion. You choose the location. If you are in your Bastion during a Bastion turn, you can relocate this door to another facility in your Bastion.

Only you and your Bastion's hirelings can open the door, which leads to a Demiplane that takes the form of a stone room. The Demiplane exists in an extradimensional space and therefore isn't attached physically to other locations in your Bastion. Neither the Demiplane nor its door can be dispelled.

## Empower: Arcane Resilience

When you issue the "Empower" order to this facility, magical runes appear on the Demiplane's walls and last for 7 days. Until the runes disappear, you gain [Temporary Hit Points](temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) equal to five times your level after spending an entire Long Rest in the Demiplane.

## Fabrication

While in the Demiplane, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to create a nonmagical object of your choice from nothing, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space in the Demiplane. The object can be no bigger than 5 feet in any dimension; can't have a value over 5 GP; and must be made of wood, stone, clay, porcelain, glass, paper, nonprecious crystal, or nonprecious metal. You must finish a Long Rest before you can take this action again.
