- **Hirelings**: 1

This Library contains a collection of books plus one or more desks and reading chairs.

## Research: Topical Lore

When you issue the "Research" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hireling to research a topic. The topic can be a legend, a known event or location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, the hireling obtains up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to you and shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them. The DM determines what information you learn.
