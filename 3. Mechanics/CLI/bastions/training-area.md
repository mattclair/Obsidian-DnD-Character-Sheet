# Training Area
*Level 9 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 4
- **Order**: empower

A Bastion can have more than one Training Area. A Training Area might be an open courtyard, a gymnasium, a music or dance hall, or a cleverly built gauntlet of traps and hazards. It might contain inanimate targets (for weapon practice), padded mats, and other equipment. One of the facility's hirelings is an expert trainer; the others serve as training partners.

When a Training Area becomes part of your Bastion, choose one trainer from the "Expert Trainers" table. On each Bastion turn, you can replace that trainer with another one from the table.

**Expert Trainers**

| Trainer Type | Empower Effect |
|--------------|----------------|
| Battle Expert | When you take damage from an attack made with an [Unarmed Strike](unarmed-strike-xphb.md) or a weapon, you can take a Reaction to reduce this damage by `1d4`. |
| Skills Expert | You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: [Acrobatics](skills.md#Acrobatics), [Athletics](skills.md#Athletics), [Performance](skills.md#Performance), [Sleight of Hand](skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand), or [Stealth](skills.md#Stealth). |
| Tools Expert | You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice. |
| Unarmed Combat Expert | When you hit with your [Unarmed Strike](unarmed-strike-xphb.md) and deal damage, the attack deals an extra `1d4` Bludgeoning damage. |
| Weapon Expert | Choose a kind of Simple or Martial weapon, such as [Spear](spear-xphb.md) or [Longbow](longbow-xphb.md). If you aren't proficient with the weapon, you gain proficiency with it. If you already have proficiency with the weapon, you can use its mastery property. |

## Empower: Training

When you issue the "Empower" order to this facility, the facility's hirelings conduct training exercises for the next 7 days. Any character who trains here for at least 8 hours on each of those days gains a benefit at the end of the training period. The benefit depends on which trainer is present in the facility, as noted in the Expert Trainers table. The benefit lasts for 7 days.
