# Sanctuary
*Level 5 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: Ability to use a [Holy Symbol](holy-symbol-xphb.md) or [Druidic Focus](druidic-focus-xphb.md) as a [Spellcasting Focus](spellcasting-focus-xphb.md)
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: craft

Icons of your religion are displayed in this facility, which includes a quiet place for worship.

## Sanctuary Charm

After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical [Charm](sanctuary-charm-xdmg.md) (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [Healing Word](healing-word-xphb.md) once without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.

## Craft: Sacred Focus

When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hireling to craft a [Druidic Focus](druidic-focus-xphb.md) ([wooden staff](wooden-staff-xphb.md)) or a [Holy Symbol](holy-symbol-xphb.md). The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The item remains in your Bastion until you claim it.
