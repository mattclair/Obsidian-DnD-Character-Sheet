# Extreme Cold
*Environmental Hazard*  

When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [Exhaustion](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level. Creatures that have [Resistance](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) or [Immunity](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save.
