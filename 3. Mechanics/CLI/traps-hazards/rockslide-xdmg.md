# Rockslide
*Generic Hazard*  

When a rockslide occurs, every creature in its path makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11 (`2d10`) Bludgeoning damage, has the [Prone](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition, and moves with the rockslide. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

When the rockslide stops, its space becomes [Difficult Terrain](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md), and all Prone creatures in its space are buried under rocks and debris. A creature buried in this way has the [Restrained](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition and has [Total Cover](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/tables/cover-xphb.md). As an action, a creature can try to crawl out from under the rock pile. If the creature succeeds on a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, it is no longer Restrained; instead, it has the [Prone](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition and is atop the rock pile. If the check fails, the creature remains buried and gains 1 [Exhaustion](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level.

A creature that has neither the Incapacitated nor the Restrained condition can spend 1 minute freeing another creature buried by the rockslide.

## At Higher Levels

You can scale this hazard for higher levels by increasing the Bludgeoning damage as follows: 22 (`4d10`) at levels 5–10, 55 (`10d10`) at levels 11–16, and 99 (`18d10`) at levels 17–20.
