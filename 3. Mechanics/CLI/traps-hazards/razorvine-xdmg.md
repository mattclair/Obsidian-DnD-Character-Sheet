# Razorvine
*Generic Hazard*  

Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, 5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11; HP 25; and [Immunity](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Psychic damage.

When a creature comes into contact with razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) Slashing damage from the bladelike thorns.
