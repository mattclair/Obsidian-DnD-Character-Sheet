# Wild Magic Zone
*Environmental Hazard*  

A past magical disaster or uncontrolled surge of power in a particular place can cause the fabric of magic to unravel, creating a wild magic zone. In such an area, which is typically no more than 300 feet in diameter, magic behaves unpredictably.

Whenever a creature expends a spell slot to cast a spell in a wild magic zone, roll `1d20`. If you roll a 20 on the die, roll on the [Wild Magic Surge](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/tables/wild-magic-surge-xphb.md) table in the "Player's Handbook" to create a magical effect.
