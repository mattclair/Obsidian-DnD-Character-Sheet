# Heavy Precipitation
*Environmental Hazard*  

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is [Lightly Obscured](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md), and creatures in the area have [Disadvantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on all Wisdom ([Perception](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.
