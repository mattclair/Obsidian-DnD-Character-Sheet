# Shield Master
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 207*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th, Proficiency with shield armor

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Shield Bash.** If you attack a creature within 5 feet of you as part of the [Attack](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action and hit with a Melee weapon, you can immediately bash the target with your Shield if it's equipped, forcing the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, you either push the target 5 feet from you or cause it to have the [Prone](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition (your choice). You can use this benefit only once on each of your turns.

**Interpose Shield.** If you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can take a Reaction to take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and are holding a Shield.
