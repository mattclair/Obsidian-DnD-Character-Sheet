# Fey-Touched
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 204*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th

Your exposure to the Feywild's magic grants you the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Fey Magic.** Choose one level 1 spell from the Divination or Enchantment school of magic. You always have that spell and the [Misty Step](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step-xphb.md) spell prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
