# Telepathic
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 208*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Telepathic Utterance.** You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.

**Detect Thoughts.** You always have the [Detect Thoughts](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts-xphb.md) spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot or spell components, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast it using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is the ability increased by this feat.
