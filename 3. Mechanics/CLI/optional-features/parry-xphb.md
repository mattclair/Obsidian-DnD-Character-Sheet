# Parry
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

When another creature damages you with a melee attack roll, you can take a [Reaction](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) and expend one Superiority Die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your Superiority Die plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
