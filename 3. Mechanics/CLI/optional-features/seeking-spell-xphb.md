# Seeking Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 142*  

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the `d20`, and you must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you've already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
