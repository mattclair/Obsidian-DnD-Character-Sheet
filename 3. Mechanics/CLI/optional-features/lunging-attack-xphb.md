# Lunging Attack
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

As a [Bonus Action](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can expend one Superiority Die and take the [Dash](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action. If you move at least 5 feet in a straight line immediately before hitting with a melee attack as part of the [Attack](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on this turn, you can add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll.
