# Commander's Strike
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 94*  

When you take the [Attack](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a willing creature who can see or hear you and expend one Superiority Die. That creature can immediately use its [Reaction](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to make one attack with a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb.md), adding the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll on a hit.
