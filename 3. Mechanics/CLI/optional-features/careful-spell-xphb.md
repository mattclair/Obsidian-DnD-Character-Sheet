# Careful Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 141. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>*  

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.
