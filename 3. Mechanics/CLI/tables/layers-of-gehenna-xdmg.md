*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 197* 

**Layers of Gehenna**

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Khalas | Lava illuminates clouds of volcanic ash and steam from the River Styx. |
| Chamada | Constant lava flows and eruptions make overland travel difficult. Iron zeppelins piloted by yugoloths drift through the constant gray ashfall. |
| Mungoth | Acidic ash mingles with falling snow on this freezing layer. |
| Krangath | The Dead Furnace is a great mountain suspended in silence and darkness, home to a coterie of liches. |
