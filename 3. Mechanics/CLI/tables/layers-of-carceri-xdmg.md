| Minethys | Stinging sand blows in unending storms, hiding the ruins of the ancient city Payratheon. |
| Colothys | Deep chasms cut between cruel mountains make foot travel nearly impossible. |
| Porphatys | Cold, acidic oceans are fed by constant black snow. |
| Agathys | Black ice streaked with red covers this frigid realm. |
