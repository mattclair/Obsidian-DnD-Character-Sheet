| 2 | One monster, bullied by the others, hangs back and flees at the first opportunity. |
| 3 | One monster is revered or even worshiped by the others, who will die for it. |
| 4 | One monster is admired by the group; its allies try to impress or help it. |
| 5 | One monster cares only for itself and not the rest of the group. |
| 6 | One monster bullies the others; it forces them into danger, but they want it defeated. |
