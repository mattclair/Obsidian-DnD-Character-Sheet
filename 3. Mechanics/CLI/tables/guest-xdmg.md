# Guest
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 352* 

| dice: 1d4 | Guest |
|-----------|-------|
| 1 | The guest is an individual of great renown who stays for 7 days. At the end of their stay, the guest gives you a letter of recommendation (see ""Marks of Prestige"" in "chapter 3"). |
| 2 | The guest requests sanctuary while avoiding persecution for their beliefs or crimes. They depart 7 days later, but not before offering you a gift of `1d6 × 100` GP. |
| 3 | The guest is a mercenary, giving you one additional Bastion Defender. The guest doesn't require a facility to house them, and they stay until you send them away or they're killed. |
| 4 | The guest is a [Friendly](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/friendly-attitude-xphb.md) monster, such as a brass dragon or a treant. If your Bastion is attacked while this monster is your guest, it defends your Bastion, and you lose no Bastion Defenders. The monster leaves after it defends your Bastion once or when you send it away. |
