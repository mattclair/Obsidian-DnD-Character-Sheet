**Magic Item's Quirk**

| dice: 1d8 | Quirk |
|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Blissful. You feel fortunate and optimistic about what the future holds. Butterflies and other harmless creatures might frolic in the item's presence. |
| 2 | Confident. The item helps you feel self-assured. |
| 3 | Covetous. You become obsessed with material wealth. |
| 4 | Fragile. The item crumbles, frays, chips, or cracks slightly when wielded, worn, or activated. This quirk has no effect on its properties. |
| 5 | Loud. The item makes a loud noise—such as a clang, a shout, or a resonating gong—when used. |
| 6 | Metamorphic. The item periodically alters its appearance in slight ways. You have no control over these minor alterations, which have no effect on the item's use. |
| 7 | Painful. You experience a harmless flash of pain when using the item. |
| 8 | Repulsive. You feel a sense of distaste when in contact with the item and continue to experience discomfort while bearing it. |
