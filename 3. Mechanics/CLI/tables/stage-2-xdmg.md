| dice: 1d20 | Encounter |
|------------|-----------|
| 1–14 | No encounter |
| 15 | An [Indifferent](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/indifferent-attitude-xphb.md) [Giant Ape](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-ape-xmm.md) protects its territory; its primary concern is getting the party to leave. |
| 16 | A [Hostile](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb.md) [Tyrannosaurus Rex](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/tyrannosaurus-rex-xmm.md) is on the hunt and tries to eat the characters. |
| 17 | Three [Allosauruses](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/allosaurus-xmm.md) are hunting in the jungle; they are [Hostile](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb.md) and treat the party as prey. |
| 18 | Two [Ankylosauruses](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/ankylosaurus-xmm.md) tromp through the forest nearby. They are territorial and aggressive but [Indifferent](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/indifferent-attitude-xphb.md), and they won't pursue a fleeing party. |
| 19 | A band of humans, including a [Warrior Veteran](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/warrior-veteran-xmm.md) and eight [Warrior Infantry](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/warrior-infantry-xmm.md), watch the party. They are [Indifferent](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/indifferent-attitude-xphb.md); they live in the jungle and aren't used to seeing other people. |
| 20 | Four [Minotaurs of Baphomet](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur-of-baphomet-xmm.md) prowl the jungle looking for Humanoids they can capture and bring back to the temple. |
