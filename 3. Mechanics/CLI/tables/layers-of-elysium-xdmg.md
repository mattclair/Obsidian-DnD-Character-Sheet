**Layers of Elysium**

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Amoria | Small towns on the banks of the River Oceanus, surrounded by lush meadows, are among the most hospitable refuges on the Outer Planes. |
| Eronia | Steep hills, craggy mountains, and white granite valleys offer a rugged home for hardy souls. |
| Belierin | Lighthouses pierce the fog and form hubs for small communities amid sprawling marshlands. |
| Thalasia | The Heroic Isles, rising from the headwaters of the River Oceanus, hold the best departed souls. |
