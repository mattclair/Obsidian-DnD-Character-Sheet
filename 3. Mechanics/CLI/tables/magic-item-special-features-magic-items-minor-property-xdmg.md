**Magic Item's Minor Property**

| dice: 1d20 | Minor Property |
|------------|----------------|
| 1–2 | Beacon. You can take a Bonus Action to cause the item to shed [Bright Light](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 10 feet, or to extinguish the light. |
| 3 | Compass. You can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to learn which way is magnetic north. Nothing happens if this property is used in a location that has no magnetic north. |
| 4 | Delver. While underground, you always know the item's depth below the surface and the direction to the nearest staircase, ramp, or other path leading upward. |
| 5–6 | Guardian. The item warns you, granting a +2 bonus to your [Initiative](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) rolls if you don't have the [Incapacitated](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition. |
| 7–8 | Harmonious. Attuning to this item takes only 1 minute. |
| 9 | Key. The item is used to unlock a container, chamber, vault, or door. |
| 10 | Secret Message. A message is hidden somewhere on the item. It might be visible only at a certain time, under the light of one phase of the moon, or in a specific location. |
| 11–12 | Sentinel. The DM chooses a kind of creature, such as mind flayers or trolls. This item glows faintly when such creatures are within 120 feet of it. |
| 13 | Songcraft. Whenever this item is struck or is used to strike a foe, you hear a fragment of an ancient song. |
| 14–15 | Strange Material. The item was created from a material that is bizarre given its purpose. Its durability is unaffected. |
| 16 | Temperate. You are unharmed by temperatures of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, and 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. |
| 17 | Unbreakable. The item can't be broken. Special means must be used to destroy it. |
| 18 | War Leader. You can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to cause your voice or signal to carry clearly for up to 600 feet until the end of your next turn. |
| 19 | Waterborne. This item floats on water and other liquids. You have [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Strength ([Athletics](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to swim. |
| 20 | Roll twice, rerolling any additional 20s. |
