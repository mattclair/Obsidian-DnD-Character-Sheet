| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Lunia | In the Silver Heaven, the holy water of the Silver Sea laps at the base of the celestial mountain under a starry sky. |
| Mercuria | The Golden Heaven's tame slopes and lush valleys are bathed in golden light that evokes the hope of a new dawn. |
| Venya | In the Pearly Heaven, terraced fields and tended woodlands dot the snowy slopes. |
| Solania | In the Crystal Heaven, holy shrines glitter under a silvery sky amid luminescent fog. |
| Mertion | On the sweeping plains of the Platinum Heaven, holy soldiers muster in grand citadels for battles across the planes. |
| Jovar | The Glittering Heaven, strewn with beautiful rubies and garnets, is home to the seven-tiered Heavenly City. |
| Chronias | The Illuminated Heaven is an ineffable mystery. |
