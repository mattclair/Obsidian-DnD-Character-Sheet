# Summon Construct
*4th-level, Conjuration*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/summon-construct.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lockbox worth 400+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth the spirit of a Construct. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [Construct Spirit](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/construct-spirit-xphb.md) stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a material: Clay, Metal, or Stone. The creature resembles an animate statue (you determine the appearance) made of the chosen material, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes**: [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Clockwork Sorcery)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-clockwork-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
