# Bestow Curse
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration. Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:

- Choose one ability. The target has [Disadvantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.  
- The target has [Disadvantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against you.  
- In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the [Dodge](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action on that turn.  
- If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra `1d8` Necrotic damage.  

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain [Concentration](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require [Concentration](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration), and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5-6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7-8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
