# Dissonant Whispers
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `3d6` Psychic damage and must immediately use its [Reaction](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md), if available, to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer (Aberrant Sorcery)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-aberrant-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock (Great Old One Patron)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-great-old-one-patron-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
