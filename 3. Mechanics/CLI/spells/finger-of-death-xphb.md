- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S

You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `7d8 + 30` Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a [Zombie](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie-xmm.md) that follows your verbal orders.

**Classes**: [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Warlock](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Wizard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
