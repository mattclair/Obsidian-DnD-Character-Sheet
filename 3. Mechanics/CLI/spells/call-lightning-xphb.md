# Call Lightning
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a [Cylinder](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d10` Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you're outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by `1d10`.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 3.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md)
