As you hit the target, it takes an extra `1d6` Fire damage from the attack. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target takes `1d6` Fire damage and then makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell continues. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** All the damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
