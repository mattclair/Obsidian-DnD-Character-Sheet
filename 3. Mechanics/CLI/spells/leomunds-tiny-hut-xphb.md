# Leomund's Tiny Hut
*3rd-level, Evocation (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a crystal bead)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

A 10-foot [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell fails when you cast it if the [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) isn't big enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its area.

Creatures and objects within the [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) when you cast the spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can't be cast through it, and the effects of such spells can't extend into it.

The atmosphere inside the [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to have [Dim Light](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) (no action required). The [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is opaque from the outside and of any color you choose, but it's transparent from the inside.

The spell ends early if you leave the [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) or if you cast it again.
