# Spiritual Weapon
*2nd-level, Evocation*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/spiritual-weapon.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral force that resembles a weapon of your choice and lasts for the duration. The force appears within range in a space of your choice, and you can immediately make one melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of the force. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to `1d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a [Bonus Action](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) on your later turns, you can move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for every slot level above 2.
