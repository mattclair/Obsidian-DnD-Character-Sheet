# Shapechange
*9th-level, Transmutation*  
![](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/shapechange.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth 1,500+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you take a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new form must be of a creature that has a [Challenge Rating](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/challenge-rating-xphb.md) no higher than your level or [Challenge Rating](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/challenge-rating-xphb.md). You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can't be a Construct or an Undead.

When you cast the spell, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) of the first form into which you shape-shift. These [Temporary Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) vanish if any remain when the spell ends.

Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md); [Hit Point Dice](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-point-dice-xphb.md); proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.

Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.

**Classes**: [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Wizard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
