# Aura of Life
*4th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot [Emanation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have [Resistance](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Necrotic damage, and your [Hit Point](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximums can't be reduced. If an ally with 0 [Hit Points](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) starts its turn in the aura, that ally regains 1 [Hit Point](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md).

**Classes**: [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric (Life Domain)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-life-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Paladin](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
