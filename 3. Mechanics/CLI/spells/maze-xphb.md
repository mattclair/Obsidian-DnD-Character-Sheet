# Maze
*8th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a [Study](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Study) action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

**Classes**: [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
