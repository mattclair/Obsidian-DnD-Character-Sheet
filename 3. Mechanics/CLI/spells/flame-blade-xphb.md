# Flame Blade
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sumac leaf)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a [Bonus Action](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).

As a [Magic](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to `3d6` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

The flaming blade sheds [Bright Light](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 10 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Sorcerer](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md)
