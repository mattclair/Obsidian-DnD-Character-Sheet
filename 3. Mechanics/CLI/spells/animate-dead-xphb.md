# Animate Dead
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a [Skeleton](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton-xmm.md) if you chose bones or a [Zombie](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie-xmm.md) if you chose a corpse.

On each of your turns, you can take a [Bonus Action](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the [Dodge](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating a new creature.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You animate or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
