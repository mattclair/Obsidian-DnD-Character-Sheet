# Haste
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's [Speed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to [Armor Class](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md), it has [Advantage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the [Attack](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) (one attack only), [Dash](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage), [Hide](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Hide), or [Utilize](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action.

When the spell ends, the target is [Incapacitated](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and has a [Speed](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Paladin (Oath of Glory)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-glory-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-vengeance-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Wizard](3.%20Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
