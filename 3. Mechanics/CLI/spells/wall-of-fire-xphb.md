# Wall of Fire
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of charcoal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d8` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals `5d8` Fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 4.
